# optoFind
Opto Refussed to give me the source for their trashy groov find app which deafults to breaking your network with link local garbage, so I made my own which doesnt do that. 
It might not work right yet, but it does make sure to not break your networking on purpose, so thats a win.

plus it works on linux, so bite me Opto.
